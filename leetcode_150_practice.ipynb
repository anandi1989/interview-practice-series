    "### 88. Merge Sorted Array\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3\n",
    "Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]\n",
    "Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].\n",
    "The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0\n",
    "Output: [1]\n",
    "Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].\n",
    "The result of the merge is [1].\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1\n",
    "Output: [1]\n",
    "Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].\n",
    "The result of the merge is [1].\n",
    "Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.\n",

    "Constraints:\n",

    "nums1.length == m + n\n",

    "## Solution: \n",
    "\n",
    "To merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array in-place, follow these steps:\n",
    "Approach\n",
    "Initialize Pointers: Use three pointers:\n",
    "\n",
    "i starting at the last valid element of nums1 (index m-1).\n",
    "j starting at the last element of nums2 (index n-1).\n",
    "k starting at the end of the merged array (index m+n-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge from the End: Compare elements from nums1 and nums2 starting from the end. Place the larger element at position k and move the respective pointer backward. This avoids overwriting elements in nums1 before they are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle Remaining Elements: If there are remaining elements in nums2 after the main loop, copy them to the beginning of nums1 as they are already sorted and smaller than the processed elements.\n"
